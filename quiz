1) What is the mass of a photon?
The mass of a photon is zero.
2) What is the size of a quark?
10^(-15)>quark>10^(-35)
3) What is the difference between electrical charge and color charge?
The difference between electrical charge and color charge is that color charge is responsible for the strong force acting on quarks and anti-quarks, whereas electric charge causes matter to experience force in an electromagnetic field.
4) Explain the difference between a boson and a fermion?
A boson has an integer spin; a fermion has a half-integer spin.
5) Describe what type of particle is both a boson and a hadron.  Give and example.
A quark is both a boson and a hadron.
6) Explain the purpose of a bubble chamber.
A bubble chamber is used to detect electrically charged particles moving through it.
7) What are leptons made of?
Elementary particles
8) Name two leptons and two baryons.
Types of leptons are the electron and the muon; typees of baryons are the proton and the neutron.
9) Explain what quantities are conserved at each vertex of a Feynmenn diagram.
The quantities that are conserved at each vertex of a Feynman diagram are the electron, the positron, the quark, and the antiquark.
10) Explain what an "exchange particle" is.  Describe its function and provide an example.
An exchange particle is something that interacts with ordinary articles to produce the effect of attraction or repulsion. An example of an exchange particle is gluon.
